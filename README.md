# Hackathon Prototype

A minimal prototype scaffolded for rapid iteration during a hackathon. This repository starts as a static site so it runs anywhere without extra tooling.

## Getting Started

- Open `public/index.html` in your browser, or
- Serve the `public` directory with any static file server.

## Project Structure

- `public/` â€“ Static assets and the entry HTML file

## Next Steps

- Add your preferred runtime or framework (Node, Python, .NET, etc.)
- Wire up a simple API or mock data
- Add a build step if needed (bundler, TypeScript, etc.)

## License

Unlicensed (for hackathon prototyping). Add a LICENSE if needed.
